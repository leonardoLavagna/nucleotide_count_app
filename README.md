In this repository there is the surce code for the application dna-nucleotide-count-app that counts and visualize the number of nucleotides present in a DNA string. 

### Use the app
Here is the link at the app: [https://nucleotidecount.streamlit.app/](https://nucleotidecount.streamlit.app/)

### What's in here?
- The **script** for the app `dna-app.py`
- A **configuration file** needed to deploy the app on streamlit `requirements.txt`
- a **logo** `dna-logo.jpg`

No dataset was needed to carry out the analysis (just input a valid DNA string). In any case there are many collections of DNA strings freely available out there, e.g. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nageshsingh/dna-sequence-dataset
